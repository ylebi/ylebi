## Introduction
In the dynamic world of Kubernetes, operators play a pivotal role in simplifying complex processes and enhancing automation. Following up on our previous exploration of what Kubernetes Operators are, in this guide, we will dive into the practical side of developing your own Kubernetes Operator. For those new to the topic or in need of a refresher, feel free to visit [our earlier post on Kubernetes Operators](/posts/how-to-develop-kubernetes-operators-from-the-ground-up/).

Today, we focus on building a real-world example: the **memcached-operator**. This guide will not only illustrate the steps involved in developing an operator but will also provide you with a hands-on example that you can adapt and expand according to your needs. Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your Kubernetes deployments or a hobbyist curious about the inner workings of Kubernetes tools, this walkthrough aims to equip you with the knowledge to kickstart your operator development journey.

## Why memcached-operator?
When embarking on the journey of Kubernetes operator development, selecting the right project as your starting point can significantly influence your learning curve and the practicality of your understanding. Memcached, a high-performance distributed memory caching system, is widely used in the industry to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. Building an operator for Memcached thus provides a relevant and insightful case study due to its broad applicability and the clear benefits it offers in a Kubernetes environment.

The **memcached-operator** encapsulates all the operational knowledge needed to manage a Memcached cluster on Kubernetes. By automating tasks such as deployments, scaling, and configuration management, the operator not only simplifies these processes but also ensures they are handled consistently. This makes memcached-operator not just a tool for efficiency but a showcase of the power of Kubernetes operators in managing stateful applications in a cloud-native ecosystem.

This section sets the stage by highlighting the practical significance of our chosen example, gearing us up for the hands-on development walkthrough that follows. With this context in place, learners can appreciate the real-world applications of the concepts they are about to explore.

## Step 1: Environment Setup
Before diving into the development, it's crucial to understand the core concepts of Kubernetes like Pods, Services, and StatefulSets. Familiarize yourself with the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Development Environment
Before diving into the development of the memcached-operator, itâ€™s essential to establish a proper environment that fosters an efficient and effective workflow. Setting up your development environment correctly from the outset can save time and prevent common pitfalls.

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/): Essential for building and managing containers, Docker will be used to package your memcached-operator and its dependencies.
[**Kubernetes Cluster**](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/): You can set up a local cluster using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), or use a cloud-based solution like [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/eks/), or [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) for testing purposes.
[**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/): The Kubernetes command-line tool, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters and is crucial for deploying and managing applications.
[**Operator SDK**](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/): The Operator SDK provides the tools necessary to build, test, and package Kubernetes operators. Ensure you have the latest version installed, as it includes templates and commands to streamline operator development.

### Configuring Your Environment
1. **Set up your Kubernetes cluster:** If using Minikube, start your cluster by running minikube start. For cloud clusters, ensure you have the cluster configured and kubectl connected to your cluster with the appropriate credentials.
2. [**Install Operator SDK:**](/posts/how-to-develop-kubernetes-operators-from-the-ground-up/) Follow the installation guide specific to your operating system from the official Operator SDK documentation.
With these components in place, your development environment is ready to handle the creation and management of a Kubernetes operator.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building the memcached-operator
Developing a Kubernetes Operator involves several key steps, from creating the initial scaffolding to defining custom resources and implementing controller logic. Here, we'll break down the process of building the **memcached-operator** into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Create the Operator Scaffolding
**Initialize Your Operator Project:** Begin by creating a new directory for your operator and navigate into it. Then, initialize your operator project using the Operator SDK:
```bash
mkdir memcached-operator
cd memcached-operator
operator-sdk init --domain=example.com --repo=github.com/example/memcached-operator
```

### Step 2: Define the Memcached Custom Resource (CR)
1. **Edit the API Types:** Define the spec and status of the Memcached custom resource in the `api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go` file. For example, specify the number of Memcached nodes:
```go
type MemcachedSpec struct {
    //+kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    // Size is the size of the memcached deployment
    Size int32 `json:"size"`
}

type MemcachedStatus struct {
    // Nodes are the names of the memcached pods
    Nodes []string `json:"nodes"`
}
```

2. **Update the API:** After modifying the API definition, update the generated code for your resource:
```bash
make generate
make manifests
```

### Step 3: Implement the Controller Logic
1. **Define the Reconciliation Logic:** In the `controllers/memcached_controller.go` file, implement the reconciliation logic for your operator. This includes defining how the operator responds to create, update, and delete events:
```go
func (r *MemcachedReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
    // Logic to check the current state of the cluster
    // Logic to update the cluster to match the desired state
}
```
2. **Handle Resource Creation and Management:** Implement logic to manage the underlying Memcached instances, such as scaling up or down based on the specified size in the custom resource.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Operator
1. **Build the Operator Container:** Package your operator into a Docker container for deployment:
```bash
make docker-build docker-push IMG="example/memcached-operator:v0.1.0"
```
2. **Deploy the Operator:** Use the generated YAML files to deploy your operator to the Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
make deploy
```
3. **Verify the Deployment:** Ensure that the operator is running and managing the Memcached instances as expected by inspecting the operator's logs and the status of the Memcached custom resource.

## Testing and Deployment
Testing and properly deploying your memcached-operator are crucial steps to ensure it functions as expected in a live Kubernetes environment. This section will cover strategies for testing your operator and the steps needed to deploy it successfully.

### Testing the Operator
1. **Unit Testing:**
**Purpose:** Verify the logic within your operator, especially the reconciliation functions.
**Tools:** Use Go's built-in testing framework along with mock libraries like `controller-runtime`'s `envtest` for environment simulation.
**Implementation:** Create test cases that simulate different Kubernetes events and assert how your operator handles them.
```go
func TestMemcachedReconciliation(t *testing.T) {
    // setup test framework, mock requests, and expected responses
    // call your reconciliation method
    // verify the outcome using assertions
}
```
2. **Integration Testing:**
**Purpose:** Ensure that your operator interacts correctly with Kubernetes APIs and behaves as expected in a more realistic environment.
**Tools:** Kubernetes Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) or a temporary Minikube environment can serve as test clusters.
**Implementation:** Deploy your operator and resources it manages, then use Kubernetes commands to observe and validate operational behavior.

### Deployment
1. **Operator Deployment:**
**Prepare the Operator Manifests:** Ensure all your YAML files are updated and correct, including your CRDs, RBAC settings (like Roles and RoleBindings), and Operator Deployment.
**Deploy to Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases
kubectl apply -f config/operator
```
**Verify:** Check that your operator is deployed correctly and is operational.
2. **Memcached Custom Resource Deployment:**
**Deploy an Instance of Memcached:**
```yaml
apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcached-sample
spec:
  size: 3
```
**Apply the CR:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
```
**Check Status:** Observe the deployment and scaling of Memcached instances.
```bash
kubectl get all
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance
**Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring using Kubernetes tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track the health and performance of your operator and its managed instances.
**Maintenance:** Regularly update the operator with new features, security patches, and Kubernetes API changes.
